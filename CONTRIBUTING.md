# Contributing to Memcache Settings

**Please do not submit Github issues or pull requests unless they are strictly related to the Composer integration.**

For any memache-related issues, including issues with the recommended memcache settings, please contact Acquia Support. As noted in the readme, this repository is merely a mirror of the memcache configuration recommendations on docs.acquia.com. The maintainers of this repository cannot provide any memcache-related support.

Before submitting an issue or pull request, please read and take the time to understand this guide. Issues not adhering to these guidelines may be closed.

## Submitting issues

Please choose your issue type carefully. If you aren't sure, odds are you have a support request.
- **Feature request**: a request for a specific enhancement to be made. This is distinct from a bug in that it represents a _gap_ in functionality, rather than an instance of the plugin behaving badly. It is distinct from a support request in that it has a specific and atomic request for new functionality, rather than being a general request for help or guidance.
- **Bug report**: a clearly defined instance of not behaving as expected. It is distinct from a feature request in that it represents a mismatch between what _does_ and what _claims to do_. It is distinct from a support request in that it has _specific steps to reproduce the problem_.
- **Support request**: a request for help or guidance. Use this if you aren't sure how to do something or can't find a solution to a problem that may or may not be a bug. Before filing a support request, please review the FAQ for solutions to common problems and general troubleshooting techniques. If you have an Acquia subscription, consider filing a Support ticket in order to receive support subject to your SLA.

After you have chosen your issue type, make sure to fill out the issue template completely.

Note the following when submitting issues:
* Issues filed directly to the project are not subject to an SLA.
* The project maintainers are under no obligation to respond to support requests, feature requests, or pull requests.


## Submitting pull requests

Pull requests must adhere to the following guidelines:
- PRs should be atomic and targeted at a single issue rather than broad-scope.
- PRs must contain clear testing steps and justification, as well as all other information required by the pull request template.
- PRs must pass automated tests before they will be reviewed. We recommend you run the tests locally before submitting.
- PRs must comply with Drupal coding standards and best practices as defined by the project maintainers.
